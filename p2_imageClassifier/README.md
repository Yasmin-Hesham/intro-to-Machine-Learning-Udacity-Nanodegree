# Build an Image Classifier
## Deep Learning
### Project 2:
**Taregt:**
Building a deep learning to recognize different species of flowers.

**Steps:**
### Part 1:
- Building Neural Networks and Training the Model.

### Part 2:
- Convert the code into a Python application that will be ran from the command line by parsing the paths of:
  - the model 
  - the image of a flower
  - the number of the top predicted species
